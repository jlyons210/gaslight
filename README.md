# GASLIGHT
This was a quickly thrown together proof-of-concept to see how various OpenAI chat models react to spoofed `assistant` prompts. It can also be used as a basic chat interface, if no spoofing is used. It can yield entertaining results - YMMV.

## Usage
```sh
./gaslight.py -a [openai_api_key] -m [model - default: gpt-3.5-turbo]
```
